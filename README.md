# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (C++ with CC212SGL)

A modern **Tic Tac Toe** game built in **C++** with **fancy graphics on the command line** using the `CC212SGL` graphics library.  
The project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, the use of **data structures**, and **algorithmic logic** to handle game conditions and rendering.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🖼️ **Custom Graphics in CMD** (using `CC212SGL`)
- ♟️ **Player vs Player** Tic Tac Toe
- 🧠 Uses **Data Structures & Algorithms** to manage game states and win conditions
- 🎯 **Object-Oriented Design** for clean, modular code
- 🔒 **Disabled CMD Interactions** to prevent unwanted interference with the graphics

## ⚙️ Requirements
- C++17 or later
- [CC212SGL Graphics Library](#) (make sure it is installed/configured)
- Windows Command Prompt (tested environment)
